## Q&A
1. Why isn't there a Windows version?
   - I don't have a Windows computer, so I can't maintain and test it. If you have a Windows computer, you can package it yourself, and I also welcome any pull requests.
2. What are the differences compared to the web version?
   - Apart from being more concise and convenient, there are no differences. However, if you are a Mac user, you can use shortcuts to summon the pop-up without opening a browser.
3. Is it free to use?
   - Yes, it is an open-source project, and you can use it for free.
4. Does this application require a VPN or proxy?
   - Whether or not you need to bypass internet restrictions depends on the requirements in your region, as it is based on the web version.
